# WizardChess

Physical recreation of the Wizard Chess set used in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Voice recognition (CMUSphinx running on a Raspberry Pi) in conjunction with stepper motors, an electromagnet attached to a self-built plotter, and 3D-printed chess pieces + a laser-etched board!

Created during Carnegie Mellon's Build18 hardware hackathon! See http://build18.org/wiki/index.php/Wizard_Chess for more information. Watch the video demo at http://tinyurl.com/WizardChess!
